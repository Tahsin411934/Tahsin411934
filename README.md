### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
First and foremost I am Muslim and truly believe in the Almighty Allah. Without him I'm nothing.

I am a student of Computer Science and I found developing android applications interesting. So, I started learning Java and working with Android Studio and Adobe Illustrator & Adobe XD for UI designing.
It's fun to make new applications!

I also have experience in Web Development, Graphic Designing and also work at Upwork and Fiverr as a web developer.

Skills: VUE JS / REACT / JS / HTML / CSS

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on .
